# Binary_Search
binary search with C++

At each step we will divide the string into two subsequences that have no element in common and which together form the string from which we started in the current step.
Depending on the element we want to find in the string, we will choose one of the sequences and search for it there using the same procedure.

Compile: g++ -Wall -o bsearch binary_search.cpp
Run: ./bsearch
